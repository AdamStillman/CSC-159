The commands in .LM1 sets up the stack. 

The command in .LM3 puts the constant 128 on the stack.

Inside .LM4:
	First line moves the 128 from above into %edx
	Second line moves %edx into %eax, so both contain 128
	Third adds %eax (128) to %edx (also 128), so %edx is now 256
	Fourth pushes that 256 onto the stack
	Fifth pushes the string "%d Hello world %d \nECS" onto the stack
	Sixth calls the prinf function to print the string on the local console.

Inside .LM5:
	First line pushes "--> Hello world <--\nCPE/CSC" onto the stack
	Second calls cons_printf to print the string on the remote console

Inside .LM6:
	Jump to .L1

Inside .L1:
	Finish up and return
